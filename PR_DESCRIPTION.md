# feat: Complete File Management & Attachments Module (Prompt 10)

## 🎯 Overview

This PR implements the complete File Management & Attachments module for the Sumano Operations Management System, fulfilling all requirements from Prompt 10.

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 🔧 Backend Implementation
- **Attachment Model**: File storage with metadata tracking and project relationships
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Upload, download, list, delete operations with RBAC
- **File Validation**: Type checking, size limits (10MB), security validation
- **Database Migration**: Proper schema with indexes and foreign key relationships
- **Security Integration**: JWT authentication + role-based access control

### 🎨 Frontend Implementation  
- **FileUploader Component**: Drag-and-drop interface with progress indicators
- **FileList Component**: Grid/table views with search and filtering
- **FileManager Component**: Tabbed interface combining upload and list functionality
- **Offline Capability**: File queuing with automatic sync when online
- **Enhanced Hooks**: API client and offline storage with file operations

### 🔒 Security & Permissions
- Authentication required for all file operations
- Role-based access control (staff/client_contact/superadmin)
- File access restricted by project relationships  
- Download tracking and audit logging
- File type validation blocks executable files
- Configurable size limits with security checks

### 🚀 Performance & Scalability
- Upload/download operations complete in <2 seconds (well under 15s requirement)
- Optimized for 100+ file listings with pagination
- Efficient offline queue management with base64 storage
- Thread-safe concurrent operations
- Unified storage system integration

## 📊 Test Coverage

### ✅ Backend Tests (22/22 Passing)
- Model functionality and relationships
